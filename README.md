# LineageOS 17.1 Device Tree
This branch is currently not maintained. It's able to build a bootable LineageOS recovery.

If you want to build LineageOS, I'd suggest to use the `android10-rk3399` branch as base and apply [364af126cb60f7662e1d770d0fc55802c72885c7](https://github.com/TBT8A10/android_device_rockchip_rk3368a/commit/364af126cb60f7662e1d770d0fc55802c72885c7) on top of it.
